        <b>Lasagna</b> (US: /lə'za:njə/, also UK: /lə'zænjə/,[1] Italian: [la'zaɲɲa]
        also known as lasagne, Italian: [la'zaɲɲe]) is a type of pasta, 
        possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets.
        Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers
        of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù 
        (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses 
        (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and 
        seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, 
        oregano and basil.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, 
        which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is 
        assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. 
        The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square 
        portions.

            cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
